# Chancla Events Organizations

This is a project meant to create an application to replace our use of Eventbrite and Meetup.com. We are looking for developers to help us build the idea up via feature requests and then help contribute code to this project.

Tech stack and other items can be decided at a later date (11/19/19 is the first day this was made), but we are looking to solve for issues that the community has faced when organizing events.

Contribute an issue (feature request) today!
